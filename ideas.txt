since every pixel = 1 image; then make every image larger that the pixel was, so the images overlap, creating the image filled with doodles effect
if the images overlap in a too uniform way, create a boolean that decides if it is on top or below the previous generated image
try to add shadows with different alphas in the png image doodles so that the color filter will look drawn
